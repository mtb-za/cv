Dear Professor Doucouré,

Further to our recent correspondence, I would like to express my strong interest in the MSc project you proposed with the African Earth Observatory Network.

Because of my passionate love of Geological Science and Computer Sciences in general, I have often faced the dilemma of having to choose between the two. To find a possibility to deepen my knowledge and understanding of both fields, as this MSc project proposes, is something I have been looking for since 2009. 

I think that the use of remote sensing geophysical techniques, particularly those relating to groundwater and agriculture, and the communication of results of these investigations publically, is extremely important for the future well-being of South Africa and its people. At the same time, I feel that the application of computing science to solve problems relating to earth sciences will allow for many problems to be solved more quickly and more cheaply than before. The processing and synthesis of the large amounts of disparate data that the different subfields of geoscience collect, and finding applications for this data is a fascinating challenge.

In my current employment at a consulting engineering firm, I have played a key role in the completion of a number of projects under budget and on deadline. This has given me a good sense of time management, the ability to work under pressure, and increased my confidence. It has also reinforced the importance of working in a logical and accountable manner. Most of the work projects I have undertaken involved the management of, and co-operation with, different teams in order to achieve completion. I have the discipline and focus to follow through on hard problems until they are solved. I am also quick to grasp new concepts, work hard, and am self-motivated.

In the last two years, I have acquired a better understanding of the real world and have come to the realisation that if I wish to excel in a fast-moving and highly competitive world, further studies will be required. I have a clear vision of what I want to accomplish, and this project will bring me closer to my goal. My working experience, combined with my proven ability to write technical reports and handle multiple projects with variable deadlines, will definitely be additional assets to consider towards my success with this MSc.

I firmly believe that I would be an asset to AEON, and would greatly appreciate the opportunity to prove myself. I will make myself available for an interview at your convenience and look forward to hearing from you.

I can be reached on 073 467 3333 or mtb@martinb.za.net at any time should you require further information.

Yours sincerely,  
Martin Bentley
