##Work Experience

All the positions that I have held have helped me develop time-management skills and quick decision-making as to current priorities in order to achieve goals. They have also involved learning working as part of a team, including in a leading capacity, and many involved extensive communication with third parties. My various positions have also required adaptability to rapidly changing circumstances and rapid learning while on the job.
